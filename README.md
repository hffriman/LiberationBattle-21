<h3>Core Idea</h3>
<p>In this game, you must defeat the enemy with four different actions: SWORD ATTACK, GUN ATTACK, HEALTH RESTORATION and WEAPON REPAIRMENT.</p>
<p>The success and strength of these actions is decided by the classic card game 21 (also known as Blackjack). In it, your objective is to draw cards one by one, attempting to get your total score as close to 21 as possible.</p>
<p>If you draw enough cards to get an exact score of 21, your action will get special effects! Investigate them and find the way to defeat NOSFERATU.</p>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>I created this game completely on my own: all the programming, game design, art assets, music and sounds are done by me.</p>
<p>This project was developed with Qt Framework: it was my first time doing C++ Qt Development, but I have learnt a lot (despite my code not being the most optimal as of now).</p>

<h3>Future Plans</h3>
<p>I have plans to create a complete edition of this game with Unity Game Engine. It would contain a full story with a lot of exciting opponents, each of them challenging the player with different classic card games.</p>
<p>I cannot promise the exact date for this definite version, but I will work hard towards it.</p>
